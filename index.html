		US ally reportedly calls Biden foreign policy in Kosovo 'naive' amid rising tensions with Serbia
		<!-- Post 1		-->
		U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken faced criticism from a close ally as ethnic tensions have once again flared in the Balkans.
		Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti took a shot at Blinken, who had criticized Kosovo's government for "actions it took against the advice of the United States and Kosovo’s European partners," according to a statement from Blinken.
		Kurti didn’t shy away, telling The Guardian newspaper in an interview last week, "I think it’s not just unfair and wrong and hurtful but at the same time very naive." He also said the comments were appeasing Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.

		U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s announcement that he is working with European partners to outline a voluntary artificial intelligence (AI) conduct code has left some experts concerned about how the government plans to handle such delicate policies in the future.

		"A lot of us believe that this should be done through legal institutions, through democratic institutions and not simply as a side agreement at a trade meeting between governments and industry," Marc Rotenberg, executive director at the Center for AI and Digital Policy, told Fox News Digital.

		"I don't think that's good for the public," Rotenberg stressed. "I think the public has a right to expect that whatever these decisions will be for artificial intelligence, they'll be made through political institutions and not just at these fancy high-level meetings."

		Blinken made the announcement after a meeting of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC) with European trade partners in Sweden. European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager said generative AI was "a complete game changer" and there needs to be "accountable artificial intelligence."

		South Korea's intelligence service believes that North Korea's leader could be suffering from insomnia while abusing alcohol and tobacco.

		South Korean lawmaker Yoo Sang-bum, who serves as the executive secretary for the Parliamentary Intelligence Committee, told reporters Wednesday the country's intelligence service believes North Korean leader Kim Jong Un "may be experiencing a serious sleep disorder and engaging in excessive alcohol and tobacco consumption," according to a report from The Korea Herald.

		The lawmaker said the National Intelligence Service found North Korean authorities were "hoarding" insomnia medications such as Zolpidem and "significant amounts" of alcohol and cigarettes.

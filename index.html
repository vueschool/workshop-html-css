		<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken faced criticism from a close ally as ethnic tensions have once again flared in the Balkans.</p>
		<p>Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti took a shot at Blinken, who had criticized Kosovo's government for "actions it took against the advice of the United States and Kosovo’s European partners," according to a statement from Blinken.</p>
		<p>Kurti didn’t shy away, telling The Guardian newspaper in an interview last week, "I think it’s not just unfair and wrong and hurtful but at the same time very naive." He also said the comments were appeasing Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.</p>

		<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s announcement that he is working with European partners to outline a voluntary artificial intelligence (AI) conduct code has left some experts concerned about how the government plans to handle such delicate policies in the future.</p>
		<p>"A lot of us believe that this should be done through legal institutions, through democratic institutions and not simply as a side agreement at a trade meeting between governments and industry," Marc Rotenberg, executive director at the Center for AI and Digital Policy, told Fox News Digital.</p>
		<p>"I don't think that's good for the public," Rotenberg stressed. "I think the public has a right to expect that whatever these decisions will be for artificial intelligence, they'll be made through political institutions and not just at these fancy high-level meetings."</p>
		<p>		Blinken made the announcement after a meeting of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC) with European trade partners in Sweden. European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager said generative AI was "a complete game changer" and there needs to be "accountable artificial intelligence."</p>

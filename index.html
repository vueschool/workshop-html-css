		<h1>Chapter 12 - Alice's Evidence</h1>

		<p>
			The King turned pale and shut his note-book hastily.
			<em>Consider your verdict,</em>
			he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>No, no!</i>
			said the Queen.
			<i>Sentence first--verdict afterwards.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Stuff and nonsense!</strong>
			said Alice loudly.
			<em>The idea of having the sentence first!</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>Hold your tongue!</i>
			said the Queen, turning purple.
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>I won't!</i>
			said Alice.
			<b>Who cares for you?</b>
			(she had grown to her full
			size by this time.)
			<em>You're nothing but a pack of cards!</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
			her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried
			to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in
			the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves
			that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>Wake up, Alice dear!</i>
			said her sister;
			<b>Why, what a long sleep you've
			   had!
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Oh, I've had such a curious dream!</em>
			said Alice, and she told her sister,
			as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of
			hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished,
			her sister kissed her, and said,
			<b>It was a curious dream, dear,
			   certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.
			</b>
			So Alice got up
			and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful
			dream it had been.

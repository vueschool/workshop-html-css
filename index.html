		Chapter 12 - Alice's Evidence

		The King turned pale and shut his note-book hastily. `Consider your
		verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

		`No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'

		`Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having the
		sentence first!'

		`Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.

		`I won't!' said Alice. `Who cares for you?' (she had grown to her full
		size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'

		At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
		her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried
		to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in
		the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves
		that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

		`Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep you've
		had!'

		`Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister,
		as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of
		hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished,
		her sister kissed her, and said, `It was a curious dream, dear,
		certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up
		and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful
		dream it had been.
